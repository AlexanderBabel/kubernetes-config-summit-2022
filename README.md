# kubernetes-config-summit-2022

This project is the code for the presentation **Synapse on Steroids** on the [Matrix Summit 2022](https://cfp.summit2022.matrixmeetup.de/matrix-summit-conference-2022/schedule/) in Berlin.

It includes my setup used for hosting my matrix homeserver inside a Kubernetes cluster.
